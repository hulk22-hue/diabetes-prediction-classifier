# Diabetes Prediction Classifier

This project aims to predict whether a patient has diabetes using the PIMA Indians Diabetes Database. Various classification algorithms are implemented and evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `main.py` script.

## Results

The performance of each classifier is evaluated using a confusion matrix and ROC-AUC score. The generated images will be saved in the `images/` directory.
